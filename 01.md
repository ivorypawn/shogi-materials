### Materials For Advanced Shogi Players
TAKAHASHI, Hideaki (髙橋 英晃)

<!--
Hi. I'm Hide.
This channel is established and designed for international shogi players at an advanced level.
The title of this first video is Brinkmate Part 1.

### TAKAHASHI, Hideaki (髙橋 英晃)

### Over the Board:
- Won several national amateur titles in 🇯🇵
- Won the world open several times
- Ex-professional 2 dan

### Online Ratings (Maximum):
- 2940 (Shogi Club 24)
- 2769 (Shogi Quest)
- 8 dan (Shogi Wars)

<!--
As this is the kickstart on this channel, let me briefly introduce myself.
My full name is Hideaki Takahashi.
I have won several national amateur titles in Japan and other accomplishments as well.
-->

---
## Prerequisite
We use [Kitao–Kawasaki notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi_notation#Kitao%E2%80%93Kawasaki_notation) (Wikipedia) in this material, e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗歩-76 ☖歩-34 ☗角x22+ ☖銀x ☗角'45.</div></br>

(Because the asterisk "*" already has another use in markdown documents, it has been replaced by the apostrophe " ' ")

##
Also, some notations will be employed from chess terminology.

<!--
And let me also mention the notation that I plan to use in this video and commonly in this channel.
I'll use modified Kitao–Kawasaki notation. The example line described here is read out thus ... and so on.
You may not be familiar with this notation. It is closer to the mainstream notation used in Japan.
In addition, I will also use chess terminology for convenience.

# What is Brinkmate?

<!-- Now let's get to the today's main part.
What is brinkmate? Do you know brinkmate? -->

---
## Definition
> [Tomohide Kawasaki, *Japanese-English Shogi Dictionary*, Nekomado, 2013](https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/nekomadoshop/h047.html)

### ひっし 【必至/必死】 *n. Brinkmate.*
A threatmate, in which there is no way for the king's side to avoid the forced mate in the next move.

### ひっしもんだい 【必至問題】 *n. Brinkmate problem.*
A type of shogi problem, in which a partial position is presented, and one must find a solution to force brinkmate to the king with consecutive checks or <u>threatmates</u>.

<!-- If we were to attempt to define brinkmate in words, it might be described thus. 
...
I understand that this description alone might leave some of you puzzled. We will explore specific brinkmate positions starting from the next page.

But before moving on to the next page, one more thing. "Brinkmate problem." This is considered as the brinkmate version of 詰将棋. However, please note that the sequences for brinkmate problems include not only checks but also threatmates. I think this is akin to the rules in chess problems.

Later on, we will solve many brinkmate problems. Some of them will be challenging even for professional players.

Now let's move on to the first exercise.
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Examples
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/01.png)

Determining whether a position is brinkmate is not always straightforward.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
Check the position is brinkmate.
In particular, calculate checkmating lines for each of the following replies.

- ☖金'22
- ☖飛'92
- ☖飛'42
- ☖角'77

<!-- 
The position shown here is brinkmate, and this is the list of possible replies by White. Find checkmating lines after each move on the list. This is the today's first exercise.

Please pause the video and calculate until you come to your own conclusion. After a few seconds, we move on to the next page. 
3, 2... OK? Now let's look at the answer. 
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>

### ☖金'22...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-11 ☗金'21 ☖金x ☗桂x+ ☖玉x ☗金'22#</div>

### ☖飛'92...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'41#</div>

### ☖飛'42...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'21#</div>

### ☖角'77...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'13 ☖玉-31 ☗金'32#</div>

<!--
Here I demonstrate only the line after ☖金'22 with board and skip the rest.
...
-->

---
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/02Q.png)
## Examples
It resembles a typical brinkmate position, but this is **NOT** brinkmate!

(If ☖桂 were on 81, it would have been brinkmate)

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
White to move.

<!-- 
OK. One more exercise.
This position is NOT brinkmate. Not brinkmate, which means there is a way for White's king out from mating net. Please find how.
As before, please pause the video and calculate. 3, 2.. OK, move on to the answer.
 -->

---
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/02A.png)

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'27!</div>

###
Other 角 drops on the diagonal are also correct.

###
Confirm that Black can't lead to brinkmate from here.

<!-- 
B'27 is the move. Either B'18 or B'54, for example, is also correct.
Confirm that there is no brinkmating line for black from this position.

Through this exercise, I hope you can understand that determining whether a position is brinkmate is not necessarily straightforward. OK?

# How to proceed

<!-- Now I would like to mention how this course will proceed. -->
---
## Process
This course proceeds as follows:

1. Confirming that a basic brinkmate position is indeed brinkmate,
   - :ballot_box_with_check: done in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
2. Analyzing variations of the basic position,
3. Analyzing more practical positions.


<!-- 
This video consists of 3 steps, excluding the introduction.
In Step 1, I show a basic brinkmate position and let you confirm that the position is actually brinkmate. Today we have already done this step in Exercise 1.
In Step 2, we will see some variations of the basic position and will consider whether or not we can lead to brinkmate from each of them.
In Step 3, we will analyze more practical cases which will occur in actual games.
 -->

## :blue_book: Reference
![bg right:40% 75%](img/book.jpg)

> [Takashi Kaneko, **必死道場**. Mynavi. 2019.](https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=105424)

In my view, this is the most useful book that collects brinkmate problems for practice.

The problems on this book and their variations (which I modified for my purposes) are marked with emoji :blue_book:
in this slide.

<!-- 
BTW, I would like to introduce a book here.
There are only a few brinkmate problem books even in Japan, but this "必死道場" is, in my view, the best book among them.
In this video, I will quote some of the brinkmate problems included in this book, either verbatim or in a modified form. The quoted problems will be marked with this blue_book emoji.

# Variations

<!-- 
Now let's move on to Step 2.
 -->
---
## 香 on the 1st file
<!-- _class: small -->
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3</span>
White to move.
Analyze whether or not each of the following positions is brinkmate.
If not, calculate whether or not Black can lead to brinkmate.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.2</span> |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|           ![width:380px](img/01/03-1.png)           |           ![width:380px](img/01/03-2.png)           |

<!-- 
These are the positions with a lance on the 1st file which blocks ☗桂'13.
Please pause the video again to calculate whether or not each difference affects. If you determine it is not brinkmate, consider whether there is a continuation to reach brinkmate.
3, 2.. OK, let's move on.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.1</span>

<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div></br>

The 香 blocks ☗桂'13, but at the same time, blocks the escape room by itself.

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 (forced) ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x. (brinkmate)</div></br>

(e.g. ...☖飛'92 ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#)

<!-- 
The position of Exercise 3.1 is brinkmate. 
Let's check the previous list. 

---
However, when White plays ☖角'77 here, ☗金'32#.
And as for the other lines, the existence of the lance doesn't affect the situation.
That's why the position of Exercise3.1 is brinkmate.

What about Exercise3.2? This time, following ☖角'77☗金'32, White's king can escape to the corner.
Then Black continues to attack by ☗桂'33. White must now cover 21 and 22 simultaneously. The sac ☖金'31 doesn't work due to ☗金x☖角x33+☗金'21#. So ☖角x+ is forced and Black takes back.

Actually, this position is brinkmate, but have you considered how to checkmate if White makes a last stand here with ☖飛'92?
If not, please pause the video again and calculate... OK? ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#.
So we were able to brinkmate from the position of Exercise3.2.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/03X.png)

### Further Note: ☗桂'24
Delve into the alternative ☗桂'24:

<div class="kifu">(☗桂'24) ☖金'22 (forced)</br>☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗金x22 ☖角x+</div>

###
then Black has 2 possible options:

1. ☗桂-32+
2. ☗金'33

#### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise </span>(Optional)
Which move is better?
Or does it lead to the same?

<!-- 
Regarding Exercise 3.2, let's consider an alternative ☗桂'24, apart from ☗金'32.
...

You have 2 options here. ... Which move do you think better?
Just to be clear, this optional exercise is quite challenging. If you decide to take on the challenge, the time to pause the video might be long. OK? 3, 2... Now, let's take a look at the answer.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Further Note: ☗桂'24

#### 1. ☗桂-32+?
<div class="kifu">☖馬x ☗銀x32+ ☖金'21 ☗角'33 ☖歩'22 ☗+銀x ☖金x ☗歩'23 ☖金'21 ☗歩x22+</br>☖金x ☗金'32 ☖金'21 ☗金'23 ☖金x32 ☗金x ☖金'21... (perpetual)</div>

#### 2. ☗金'33!
<div class="kifu">☖馬x23 ☗金x ☖金'22 ☗角'44 ☖金'21 ☗桂x12+ ☖金21x ☗香'19 ☖金'21 ☗香x12+</br>☖金12x ☗角x22+ ☖金x ☗金'13 ☖飛'72 ☗金23x22 ☖飛x22 ☗金'13 ☖金'12 ☗金13x22</br>☖金x22 ☗飛'31</div>

</br>With no matter which piece White defends, Black can reach brinkmate, e.g.
- ☖歩'21 ☗金x22 ☖玉x ☗金'33 ☖玉-13 ☗飛x21+ (brinkmate)
- ☖桂'21 ☗金'32...
  - ☖金x ☗飛x+ (brinkmate)
  - ☖金'12 ☗金x21...#

<!-- 
Due to the length of the sequence, I'll skip detailed explanations for each move and only demonstrate on the board.
...
Note that 金 became out of stock.
...
As my conclusion, choosing ☗桂'24 will still lead to brinkmate in the end. However, it takes over 30 moves from the initial position, making it less straightforward compared to the main line.
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## With a promoted piece
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4</span>
White to move.
Analyze whether or not each of the following positions is brinkmate.
If not, calculate if there is a way to brinkmate.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.3</span> :blue_book: |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
|           ![width:380px](img/01/04-1.png)           |           ![width:380px](img/01/04-2.png)           |                 ![width:380px](img/01/04-3.png)                 |

<!-- 
Let's consider other variations.
Pause the video and analyze whether brinkmate can be achieved from each of these positions.
3, 2... now let's reveal the solution.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4.1</span>
<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖龍-52! (not brinkmate)</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4.3</span>
In common with <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span> in that ☗桂'13 is blocked, the introduction echoes:
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x ☖飛'92 </div></br>

Now the difference appears from <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span>: no immediate mate here, but...
<div class="kifu">☗角'44! (brinkmate)</div></br>
Ambush! (e.g. ...☖銀'31 ☗金-32 ☖歩'22 ☗銀x+ ☖銀x ☗角x+#)

<!--
The position of Exercise 4.1 is brinkmate. ☖馬 on 97 does not affect the outcome.

As for Exercise 4.2, there is no brinkmating line after ☖龍-52.

Exercise 4.3 is a bit more complicated compared to the previous two. Since the ☖馬 is preventing ☗桂'13, the line is similar to that of Exercise 3.2
...
Up to this point, the sequence was the same as in Exercise 3.2. In Exercise 3.2, we could checkmate after ☖飛'92. This time there is no mating line, but next ☗角'44 makes it brinkmate because White can't prevent the coming ☗金-32, discovered check shuting the rook.

Note that if ☖馬 were on 35 at the initial position, White could have blocked this diagonal at 44 and the conclusion would have changed.

OK. This completes step 2.

# Practical Problems

<!-- 
From here, we will consider positions that are more likely to occur in real games.
 -->
---
## From my own game
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/05.png)

This situation occurred in my own game. At that time I had only 30 seconds. :alarm_clock:

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 5</span>
Lead to brinkmate.

<!-- 
The first exercise in Step 3 is a brinkmate problem extracted from my own game. By the way, that game was a 30-second byoyomi. So if you want to be in the same situation as mine, try to set a 30-second time limit after pausing the video.
3, 2.. Now move on to the answer.
 -->
---
## From my own game
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 5</span>
<div class="kifu">☗桂'74 ☖歩x ☗飛x81+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83.</div></br>

Then we reached the same situation as in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.1</span>.

###
(I initially thought of ☗桂'75. If ☖歩 were on 93, it would have been threatmate followed by ☗飛-82+!)

<!-- 
I assume several people could conceive of the 飛 sacrifice from the context so far. But immediate ☗飛x81+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83 doesn't work. ☖金'82.

The correct first move is the 桂 sacrifice. Taking the knight is forced because any other reply would result in checkmate e.g. ☖銀'71 ☗金'62 ☖銀x ☗飛-82+ ...#. So ☖歩x ☗飛x桂+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83, then reached brinkmate.

<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/07Q.png)

## A variation of <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6.3</span>
As for <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6.3</span>, I tried to replace 金 in hand with 飛 and found it interesting position.

Creating variations on your own and analysing can help deepen your understanding of fundamental positions.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span> :blue_book:
Calculate whether to be a way to reach brinkmate.

<!--
さて、ここでExercise 6.3の持ち駒の金を飛に置換した局面を考えてみましょう。この局面は私のただの思いつきでしたが、考えてみると思いのほか面白い局面でした。
It is the last exercise, and I think highly challenging even for professionals.この問題に限ってはいっぺんに結論を提示せず、問題を分割して説明します。まずは動画を止めて、この局面から必死がかかるかどうか考えてみてください。
3,2..OK? Now move on to next page.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/07A.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>

No other way at the beginning:
<div class="kifu">☗飛'34 ☖玉-22 ☗飛x32+ ☖玉x</br>☗飛x21+
</div></br>

Since White can't accept this sacrifice, the following 3 options remain.

1. ☖玉-42
2. ☖玉-43
3. ☖玉-33

###
Which move is better?
Or does it lead to the same?

<!-- 
黒がここから必死をかけようとすれば、導入部は選択の余地がありません。
...
お分かりのように、この龍をとると☗歩-23+で必死がかかります。白の玉は逃げるしかありません。選択肢は3つありますが、あなたが白ならどれを選ぶでしょうか。
数秒後、それぞれの変化の私の結論を示します。あなたが未検討だった場合、もう一度動画を止めてこの局面を考えてください。
3,2..OK, let's move on.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>
#### 2. ☖玉-43?
leads to the immediate checkmate:
<div class="kifu">☗龍-41 ☖玉-33 ☗金'23 ☖玉-34 ☗龍-44#</div></br>

#### 3. ☖玉-33!
tries to flight from the route 34-35. Many continuations are considered, e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗龍-23 ☖玉-42 ☗桂'44 ☖金'33! ☗龍-22 ☖玉-43 ☗歩-23+ ☖銀x45 ☗とx33 ☖玉-54...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗金'44 ☖玉-42 ☗龍-61 ☖金'51! ☗桂'34 ☖玉-41 ☗金x53 ☖玉-32 ☗龍x51 ☖玉-33...</div></br>

However, none of them seem to work eventually.

<!-- 
3つのうち最悪なのは☖玉-43です。これは直ちに玉が詰みます。...

☖玉-33 の変化は難解です。一例を示すと、... ここまでくると、必死はかかりません。
ほかにも黒の攻撃手段はいろいろ考えられ、いずれの攻撃もかなり持続しますが、私は白が適切に対応すれば必死はかからないと結論しました。
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>
#### 1. ☖玉-42!
is also resilient. For example,
<div class="kifu">☗桂'44 ☖金'41! ☗龍x ☖玉-33 ☗金'36 ☖金x ☗金'25 ☖角'43...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗歩-23+ ☖飛'39 ☗龍-22 ☖歩'32 ☗とx ☖玉-52 ☗金'73 ☖玉-43 ☗龍x25 ☖飛x32+...</div>

###
In my conclusion, Black can't achieve brinkmate when White defends precisely.

<!-- 
☖玉-42 も playable な手です。以降の変化の一例を示します。...

このルートも非常に難解ですが、私の結論は「必死がかからない」です。

These lines are very close to brinkmate, and many other variations for Black beside them can be considered. However, I think it is unable to brinkmate the king.

演習パートはこれで終わりです。

# More Practically

<!-- 
最後に実戦特有の条件を２つ述べます。
 -->
---

<!-- _class: small -->
## Care of your own 玉
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/10.png)

I crafted this position, but similar positions often appear in games between top players,
e.g. ☗Sasaki, D.(7dan) - ☖Habu, Y.(9dan) on 2023-09-15.

###
Let's look at the following variation in which they attacked aggressively each other.

<div class="kifu">(☗歩'24) ☖歩x ☗飛x ☖歩'86</br>☗歩x ☖飛x ☗角x22+ ☖銀x</br>☗角'77 ☖飛x89+? ☗角x22+
</div>

<!-- 
この局面は私が勝手につくったものですが、類似の先例はたくさんあります。
まだ序盤と中盤の境界といった段階ですが、ここから互いに積極的に攻めあったとき、これまで述べた必死のポジションが現れる変化があります。
...
これは実は悪手で、☖歩'23がベターです。
...
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Care of your own 玉
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/11.png)

If White plays <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☖桂'86?</span>,

<div class="kifu">(*) ☗馬x32 ☖玉x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x</br>☗銀'23. (brinkmate)</div></br>

Alternatively if White plays <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☖桂-65</span>, Black can't choose <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">(*)</span> because

<div class="kifu">☖龍x78! ☗銀x ☖桂x57+! ...#</div></br>

Therefore Black should reply
<span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☗桂-45</span> or <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☗馬x21</span>, resulting in an advantageous endgame for Black.

<!-- 
この局面になります。ここまでこの動画を観てきたあなたの目にはもう基本形が浮かんでいるのではないでしょうか。
もし☖桂'86ならば...で勝ちになります。
しかし代えて☖桂-65とされたとき黒が(*)を実行すると、☖龍x78!☗銀x☖桂x57!...#です。したがって黒は(*)ではなく☗桂-45や☗馬x21を選ぶべきで、やや優位な終盤に入ります。
then Black has the upper hand in endgame.
このように、実戦では必死をかける際に渡した戦力で自玉が危険になる状況がありえます。concrete calculate.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Lack of pieces in hand
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/12.png)

In the preceding problems, we assumed that the opponent has all the off-board pieces in hand.

In actual games, this is not the case, and brinkmate situations often arise due to insufficient pieces in hand.

### Example
☖玉 survives if White has 銀 or 角.

Otherwise, it is brinkmate.

<!-- 
もう一つ実戦で気をつけるべき点は、相手の持ち駒です。
このポジションは、白が☖銀'22や☖角'22が可能なら詰みを逃れることができますが、もしそれらの駒がなければ必死です。
これも実戦でconcrete alanysisが重要になるパターンです。

# Summary

<!-- 
That's all for today's lecture. Let's wrap up with the main points.
 -->
