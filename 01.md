### Over the Board:
- Won several National Amateur Titles in 🇯🇵
- Won World Open for several times
- Ex-professional 2 dan

### Online Ratings (Maximum):
- 2940 (Shogi Club 24)

<!-- Since this is the first video of the channel, let me briefly introduce myself.
My full name is Takahashi Hideaki.
I have won several national amateur titles and had other accomplishments as well. I have also participated in several international shogi tournaments.
-->

---
## Prerequisite
We use [Kitao–Kawasaki notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi_notation#Kitao%E2%80%93Kawasaki_notation) (Wikipedia) in this material,

e.g. <div class="kifu">☗歩-76 ☖歩-34 ☗角x22+ ☖銀x ☗角'45.</div></br>

(Because the asterisk "*" already has another use in markdown documents, it has been replaced by the apostrophe " ' ")

##
Also, some notations will be employed from chess terminology.

<!-- Let me also mention the notation that I plan to use commonly in this channel.
In this channel, I use modified Kitao–Kawasaki notation described here. I will also use some chess terminology for convenience.
The example line shown here is read out like... and so on.
Kitao–Kawasaki notation is closer to Japanese kifu notation than to Western notation often used outside Japan, and has the advantage that it is easier for Japanese to understand and translate.

# What is Brinkmate?

<!-- Now let's get to the today's main part.
What is brinkmate? Do you know brinkmate? -->

---
## Definition
(Quote from [Tomohide Kawasaki, *Japanese-English Shogi Dictionary*, Nekomado, 2013](https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/nekomadoshop/h047.html))

### ひっし 【必至/必死】 *n. Brinkmate.*
A threatmate, in which there is no way for the king's side to avoid the forced mate in the next move.

### ひっしもんだい 【必至問題】 *n. Brinkmate problem.*
A type of shogi problem, in which a partial position is presented, and one must find a solution to force brinkmate to the king with consecutive checks or threatmates.

<!-- If we try to define brinkmate precisely in words, it would be thus. 
...
Often the term "brinkmate" is used to refer to the "brinkmate problem," but in this video, I will try to distinguish between the two.
Later on, we will solve many brinkmate problems. I think some of them will be challenging even for professional players.

I think few people can properly understand just by reading the description. So let us examine specific cases.
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Examples
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/01.png)

It is not always obvious whether a position is brinkmate or not
because there are usually many possible ways of resistance.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
Confirm that this position is brinkmate. In particular, find the mates to the following replies.

- ☖金'22
- ☖飛'92
- ☖飛'42
- ☖角'77

<!-- 
Here is an example.

The position shown here is brinkmate. You may already know that this is actually brinkmate, as it is a typical position. Its confirmation is the first exercise.

Here is the list of possible replies by white, so find the mating lines to them. And I recommend you review this list for each position that will appear later.

Please pause the video and calculate until you come to your own conclusion. After a few seconds, we move on to the next page. 
3, 2... OK? Now let's look at the answer. 
-->

<!-- _class: small -->
## Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 1</span>

### ☖金'22...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-11 ☗金'21 ☖金x ☗桂x+ ☖玉x ☗金'22</div>

### ☖飛'92...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'41</div>

### ☖飛'42...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'21</div>

### ☖角'77...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'13 ☖玉-31 ☗金'32</div>

<!--
Here I show only the line after ☖金'22 and skip the rest.
...
In case that you are not sure, I recommend you reproduce on your own board.

![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/02Q.png)
## Examples
Similar to the position known as typical brinkmate
but this is actually **NOT**!

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
Find the opponent's best reply.

### 
(*Hint*: If had 桂 on 81, it would be brinkmate)

<!-- 
OK. One more exercise.
This position is NOT brinkmate. Not brinkmate, which means there is a way out from mating net.
Can you find how? As before, please pause the video and calculate.
3, 2.. OK, move on to the answer.
 -->

---
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/02A.png)

## Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'27!</div>

###
Other drops of 角 on the diagonal are also correct.

Confirm that there is neither immediate checkmate nor line to brinkmate.

<!-- 
B'27 is the move. Either B'18 or B'54, for example, is also correct.
Confirm that there is neither mating line nor brinkmating line from here.

The lesson I hope you will learn from this exercise is that it is never obvious whether an position is brinkmate or not. -->

# How to proceed with this slide

<!-- Now I would like to mention how this course will proceed. -->
---
## Process
This course proceeds as follows:

1. Confirmation of the fundamental brinkmate position
   - :ballot_box_with_check: done in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 1</span>
2. Analysis of variations of 1.
3. Analysis of more practical cases

## 
For the sake of clarity, we may go back and forth between 2. and 3.

<!-- 
This video consists of 3 steps, excluding the introduction.
In Step 1, I introduce a basic brinkmate position and let you confirm that the position is brinkmate. Today we have already done this step in Exercise 1.
In Step 2, we will see some variations of the position we saw in Step 1 and will consider whether each of them is blinkmate or not.
In Step 3, you will try to solve more practical problems which will occur in a real game.

## :blue_book: Reference
![bg right:40% 75%](img/book.jpg)

[Takashi Kaneko, *必死道場*. Mynavi. 2019.](https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=105424)

In my view, this is the best book that collects brinkmate problems.

In this slide, the exercises on the book and their variations (which I modified on my own) are marked with emoji :blue_book:.

<!-- 
By the way, I would like to introduce a book here.
There are only a few blinkmate problem books even in Japan, but this "必死道場" is, in my view, the best book among them.
In this video, I will quote some problems from this book. They are marked with this blue_book emoji.

# Variations

<!-- 
Now let's move on to Step 2.
 -->
---
## 香 on the 1st file
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3</span>
Determine if each of the following states are brinkmate or not.
If not, analyse if there is a way to force brinkmate.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.2</span> |
| :-: | :-: |
| ![width:380px](img/01/03-1.png) | ![width:380px](img/01/03-2.png) |

<!-- 
These are the positions with a lance on the 1st file.
Note that the lances prevent ☗桂'13 (check).
Please pause the video again to calculate whether these differences affect the last conclusion. And when you find the state not brinkmate, consider if there is a continuation to brinkmate or not.
3, 2.. OK, let's move on.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.1</span>

<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div></br>

The 香 blocks ☗桂'13, but at the same time, blocks the escape room by itself.

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 (forced) ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x.</div></br>

Brinkmate in 7 moves.

(Additional note: ...☖飛'92 ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#)

<!-- 
The 1st state is still the same: brinkmate. 
Let's check the previous list. 


 -->

<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/03X.png)

### (Analysis of ☗桂'24)
Here is an example line after the alternative ☗桂'24:

<div class="kifu">
(☗桂'24) ☖金'22 ☗金'32 ☖玉-11</br>☗金x22 ☖角x+ ☗桂-32+ ☖馬x</br>☗銀x32+ ☖金'21 ☗角'33 ☖歩'22</br>☗+銀x ☖金x ☗歩'23 ☖金'21</br>☗歩x22+ ☖金x ☗金'32 ☖金'21</br>☗金'23 ☖金x32 ☗金x ☖金'21...</div>

###
Led to perpetual.

Note that ☗桂'24 can be effective when the opponent does not have sufficient 金s in hand.

## Promoted pieces
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4</span>
Determine if each of the following states are brinkmate or not.
If not, analyse if there is a way to force brinkmate.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.3</span> :blue_book: |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| ![width:380px](img/01/04-1.png) | ![width:380px](img/01/04-2.png) | ![width:380px](img/01/04-3.png) |

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 4.1</span>
<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 4.2</span>
<div class="kifu">No brinkmating continuation after ☖龍-52!</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 4.3</span>
It has in common with <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.2</span> in that the square 13 is controlled by the opponent.
Thus, the introduction echoes.
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x ☖飛'92 </div></br>

Now the difference appears from <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.2</span>: no immediate mate here.
<div class="kifu">☗角'44!</div></br>

Brinkmate! Just in case, an example continuation to mate is shown below.
<div class="kifu">☖銀'31 ☗金-32 ☖歩'22 ☗銀x22+ ☖銀x22 ☗角x22+#</div></br>

<!-- note that もし馬が35にあったら必死をかける順はない -->

# Practical Positions

## From my own game
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/05.png)

This situation occurred in my own game. At that time I had only 30 seconds. :alarm_clock:

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 5</span>
Find the line to brinkmate.

---
## From my own game
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 5</span>
<div class="kifu">☗桂'74! ☖歩x ☗飛x81+! ☖玉x ☗銀'83.</div></br>

### (Note)
I initially thought of ☗桂'75, but it was not threatmate.

If ☖歩 on 94 were on 93, ☗桂'75 would be followed by ☗飛-82+...#

## From the book :blue_book:
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6</span> :blue_book:

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.3</span> |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| ![width:380px](img/01/06-1.png) | ![width:380px](img/01/06-2.png) | ![width:380px](img/01/06-3.png) |

---
## From the book :blue_book:
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.1</span>
<div class="kifu">☗馬-41! ☖玉x ☗銀'43.</div></br>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☗桂'24! ☖歩x ☗馬x22! ☖玉x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x ☗銀'23.</div></br>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.3</span>
<div class="kifu">☗金'34! ☖玉-22 ☗歩-23+ ☖金x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x ☗金x23.</div>

![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/07Q.png)

## A variation of <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.3</span>
As for <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.3</span>, I tried to replace 金 in hand with 飛 and found it interesting position.

Creating variations on your own and analysing can help deepen your understanding of fundamental positions.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span> :blue_book:
Analyse if there is a maneuver to force brinkmate.

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/07A.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 7</span>

No other way at the beginning:
<div class="kifu">☗飛'34 ☖玉-22 ☗飛x32+ ☖玉x</br>☗飛x21+
</div></br>

Since the sacrifice cannot be accepted, the following 3 options remain.

1. ☖玉-42
2. ☖玉-43
3. ☖玉-33

#
Which move should the opponent choose?

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 7</span>
#### 2. ☖玉-43?
It leads to the immediate mate:
<div class="kifu">☗龍-41 ☖玉-33 ☗金'23 ☖玉-34 ☗龍-44#</div></br>

#### 3. ☖玉-33!
The 玉 is trying to flight from the route 34-35.
Many possible continuations are considered, for example,
<div class="kifu">☗龍-23 ☖玉-42 ☗桂'44 ☖金'33! ☗龍-22 ☖玉-43 ☗歩-23+ ☖銀x45 ☗とx33 ☖玉-54...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗金'44 ☖玉-42 ☗龍-61 ☖金'51! ☗桂'34 ☖玉-41 ☗金x53 ☖玉-32 ☗龍x51 ☖玉-33...</div></br>

But none of them seem to work eventually.

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 7</span>
#### 1. ☖玉-42!

Now we reached the conclusion that there was no way to force brinkmate.

# More Practically

<!-- _class: small -->
## More practically
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/A01.png)

Although it is imposed in problem that every other pieces are in opponent's hand, brinkmate is more likely to occur in a real game due to the possibility of the lack of pieces in hand.

For example, this 玉 will survive if there is 銀 or 角 in hand, but otherwise it is brinkmate.

It is necessary to think flexibly in a real game.
