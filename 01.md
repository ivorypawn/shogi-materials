## Prerequisite
[Kitao–Kawasaki notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi_notation#Kitao%E2%80%93Kawasaki_notation) (Wikipedia) is used in this slide, e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗歩-76 ☖歩-34 ☗角x22+ ☖銀x ☗角'45.</div></br>

See the link above for details.

(Since the asterisk "*" already serves another purpose in Markdown, they are replaced with apostrophes " ' ")

##
Also, some expressions will be employed from chess terminology.

<!--
Let me refer to the notation that I plan to use today.
I'll use the modified Kitao–Kawasaki notation. And the line described here is read out for example ... and so on.
Maybe you are not so familiar with it. It is close to the notation well used in Japan, but is less ambiguous and with higher readability than the traditional style.
I will also employ some convenient expressions from chess terminology.

# What is Brinkmate?

<!-- Now let's get to today's main section.
First of all, what is brinkmate? -->

---
## Definition
> [Tomohide Kawasaki, *Japanese-English Shogi Dictionary*, Nekomado, 2013](https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/nekomadoshop/h047.html)

### ひっし 【必至/必死】 *n. Brinkmate.*
A threatmate, in which there is no way for the king's side to avoid the forced mate in the next move.

### ひっしもんだい 【必至問題】 *n. Brinkmate problem.*
A type of shogi problem, in which a partial position is presented, and one must find a solution to force brinkmate to the king with consecutive checks or <u>threatmates</u>.

<!-- If we were to attempt to describe brinkmate in words, it might be thus. 
A threatmate, in which there is no way for the king's side / to avoid the forced mate in the next move.
Or this might be clearer: In a game, if you put the opponent's king in brinkmate / and there are no immediate means to checkmate your king afterward, your victory is guaranteed.
We will explore specific brinkmate positions / starting from the next page.

But before moving on, one more thing. "Brinkmate problem." This is considered the brinkmate version of 詰将棋. However, please note the sequences for brinkmate problems include / not only checks but also threatmates.
Later on, we will solve many brinkmate problems. Some of them will be challenging even for professional players.

Now let's move on to the first step.

<!-- _class: small -->
## The fundamental Position
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/01.png)

Determining whether a position is brinkmate is not always straightforward.

## <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
Check the position is brinkmate.
In particular, find how to checkmate after each of the following replies.

- ☖金'22
- ☖飛'92
- ☖飛'42
- ☖角'77

<!-- 
The position shown here is brinkmate, and the list is of possible replies by White. Please calculate how to checkmate after each move.
I will now count to three. Please pause the video during this time, calculate until you come to your own conclusion, and then proceed. The same approach will be followed for the subsequent exercises. OK?
3, 2... Now let's look at the answer. 
-->

---
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
<!-- 
_class: small
-->

#### ☖金'22...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-11 ☗金'21 ☖金x ☗桂x+ ☖玉x ☗金'22#</div>

#### ☖飛'92...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'41#</div>

#### ☖飛'42...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'21#</div>

#### ☖角'77...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'13 ☖玉-31 ☗金'32#</div>

<!--
Here is the solution. I demonstrate only the line after ☖金'22 on the board / and skip the rest.
...

![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/02Q.png)
## Counterexample
It resembles a fundamental brinkmate,</br>but this is **NOT** brinkmate!

## <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
White to move.

<!-- 
OK. One more exercise.
This position is NOT brinkmate. Not brinkmate, which means there is a way for White's king / out from the Black's mating net. What should White move?
As before, please pause the video and calculate. 3, 2.. OK.
 -->

---
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/02A.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'27!</div></br>

Other 角 drops on the diagonal are also correct.

###
Confirm that there is no brinkmating line for Black from this position.

<!-- 
B'27 is the move. Either B'18 or B'54, for example, is also correct.

Through these exercises, I hope you understand that determining whether a position is brinkmate / is not necessarily straightforward. OK?

# How to Proceed

<!-- Now I'd like to refer to how this course will proceed. -->
---
## Process
This course proceeds as follows:

1. Confirming that a fundamental brinkmate position is indeed brinkmate,
   - :ballot_box_with_check: done in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
2. Analyzing variations of the fundamental position,
3. Analyzing more practical positions.

<!-- 
This video consists of 3 steps, excluding the introduction.
In Step 1, I show a fundamental brinkmate position / and let you confirm that the position is actually brinkmate. Today we have already done this step in Exercise 1.
In Step 2, we will see some variations of the fundamental position / and will consider / whether or not we can lead to brinkmate from each of them.
In Step 3, we will analyze more practical cases which can occur in actual games.
 -->

## :blue_book: Reference
![bg right:35% 80%](img/book.jpg)

> [Takashi Kaneko, **必死道場**. Mynavi. 2019.](https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=105424)

In my view, this is the most useful book that collects brinkmate problems for practice.

The problems in the book and their variations (which I modified for my purposes) are marked with the emoji ':blue_book:'
in this slide.
<!-- 
BTW, I would like to introduce a book here.
There are only a few brinkmate problem books even in Japan, but this book titled as "必死道場" is, in my view, the best book among them.
In step 2 and step 3, I will quote some of the brinkmate problems / included in this book, either verbatim or in my modified form. Just in case, I contacted the author / for permission regarding the quotes / and obtained consent.
The quoted problems will be marked with the blue_book emoji.

# Variations

<!-- 
Now let's move on to Step 2.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
## <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3</span>
White to move.
Analyze whether or not each of the following positions is brinkmate.
If not, calculate whether Black can lead to brinkmate within several moves.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.2</span> |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|           ![width:380px](img/01/03-1.png)           |           ![width:380px](img/01/03-2.png)           |

<!-- 
In each of these positions, a lance is placed on the 1st file preventing ☗桂'13.
Please analyze whether or not each position is brinkmate, and whether Black can achieve brinkmate within a few moves.
OK? 3, 2.. now move on to the answer.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg center 33%](img/01/03-1.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.1</span>

<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div></br>

<!-- 
The position of Exercise 3.1 is brinkmate. The lance works nothing to avoid checkmate.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span>
###
<div class="kifu">
<iframe src="https://play.mogproject.com/?u=7k1_8l_7S1_9_9_9_9_9_9.w.GN2r2b3g3s3n3l18p~0..&embed=true&sz=25&layout=w&p=jp1&bi=n&ve=false&se=false&mlang=en" width="400" height="435"></iframe>
</div>

<!-- 
In Exercise 3.2, following ☖角'77 ☗金'32, White's king has the space at the corner. That's why it was not brinkmate.
Black continues to attack by ☗桂'33. Then White has to cover the squares both 21 and 22. Taking the knight is forced because the sacrifice ☖金'31 doesn't work. ☗金x ☖角x33+ ☗金'21#.
So ☖角x+ ☗金x.

Actually, this position is brinkmate, but have you considered ☖飛'92 and how to checkmate from here? If haven't, calculate again...(ひといき) OK? ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/03-2a.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span>

<div class="kifu">☖角'77 (forced) ☗金'32 ☖玉-11</br>☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x (brinkmate),</div></br>

e.g.
...☖飛'92 ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+</br>☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#.

<!-- 
In conclusion, Black can brinkmate in 7 moves, starting from ☗銀'23.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/03X.png)

### Further Note: ☗桂'24
Let's delve into the alternative ☗桂'24.

<div class="kifu">(☗桂'24) ☖金'22 (forced)</br>☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗金x22 ☖角x+,</div>

###
then Black has 2 possible options:

A. ☗桂-32+
B. ☗金'33

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise </span>(Optional)
Which move is better?
Or are they the same?

<!-- 
By the way, let's consider this alternative ☗桂'24, apart from ☗金'32. ↓

Which move do you think is better? Or does it lead to the same?
It would be worth mentioning that / this puzzle is challenging. If you take on the challenge, you are required concrete calculations over 20 moves after each of the choices. So I have set this exercise as optional.
Now I start counting. 3, 2.. OK? Then let's look at the answer.
 -->

<!-- _class: small -->
### Further Note: ☗桂'24

<div class="kifu">

<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/03XA.png)
### Further Note: ☗桂'24
#### A. ☗桂-32+?
<div class="kifu">☖馬x ☗銀x32+ ☖金'21</br>☗角'44 ☖歩'22 ☗+銀x ☖金x</br>☗歩'23 ☖金'21 ☗歩x22+ ☖金x</br>☗金'32 ☖金'21 ☗金'23 ☖金x32</br>☗金x ☖金'21...</div></br>

will reach repetition.

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/03XB.png)
### Further Note: ☗桂'24
#### B. ☗金'33!
<div class="kifu">☖馬x23 ☗金x ☖金'22</br>☗角'44 ☖金'21 ☗桂x12+ ☖金21x</br>☗香'19 ☖金'21 ☗香x12+ ☖金12x</br>☗角x22+ ☖金x ☗金'13...</div></br>

Remark that 金 is out of stock!

####
<div class="kifu">...☖飛'92 ☗金23x22 ☖飛x22 ☗金'13</br>☖金'21 ☗金13x22 ☖金x22 ☗飛'31...</div>

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/03XB2.png)
### Further Note: ☗桂'24
#### B. ☗金'33!
With no matter which piece White defends, Black can reach brinkmate,
e.g.
- ☖歩'21 ☗金x22 ☖玉x ☗金'33 ☖玉-13
  ☗飛x21+ (brinkmate)
- ☖桂'21 ☗金'32...
  - ☖金x ☗飛x+ (brinkmate)
  - ☖金'12 ☗金x21...#

<!-- Though White has to put some piece on 21, in any case Black can achieve brinkmate eventually as described.

In my conclusion, choosing ☗桂'24 will still lead to brinkmate in the end. However, it takes over 30 moves from the initial position, making it less straightforward compared to the main line.

<!-- _class: small -->
## <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4</span>
White to move.
Analyze whether or not each of the following positions is brinkmate.
If not, calculate whether Black can lead to brinkmate within several moves.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.3</span> :blue_book: |

<!-- 
Let's consider other variations.
Please pause the video and analyze whether brinkmate can be achieved from each of these positions.
3, 2... now let's reveal the answer.

Exercise 4.3 is complicated compared to the previous two. Since the ☖馬 is preventing ☗桂'13, the line is similar to that of Exercise 3.2.
...(☖飛'92 は動かさない)
Up to this point, the sequence was the same as in Exercise 3.2. In Exercise 3.2, it was brinkmate. This time there is no mating line after ☖飛'92, but next ☗角'44 makes it brinkmate. White can't prevent the coming ☗金-32, discovered check shutting the rook. For example, ...

<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/04-3a.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4.3</span>
In common with <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span> in that ☗桂'13 is blocked, the beginning echoes.
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33</br>☖角x+ ☗金x ☖飛'92... </div></br>

Now the difference appears from <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span>.

## <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 5</span>
Black to move. Brinkmate in several moves.

###
(This situation occurred in my own game, in which I had just 30 seconds :alarm_clock:)

<!-- 
The first exercise in Step 3 is extracted from my own game. Brinkmate in several moves.

I assume several people could conceive of the 飛 sacrifice from the context so far. But immediate ☗飛x81+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83 doesn't work because the square 73 is occupied.

The correct first move is the 桂 sacrifice. Taking the knight is forced because any other reply, for example ☖銀'71, results in checkmate: ☗金'62 ☖銀x ☗飛-82+ and so on. So ☖歩x ☗飛x桂+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83, then we reached brinkmate.

<!-- 
Attempting to brinkmate, there is no other room for the first moves.
...
As you can see, capturing this 龍 leads to brinkmate. White's king has no choice but to flee.

The worst among the three options is ☖玉-43. This move results in an immediate checkmate.

One imaginable line is ☗金'44 ☖玉-42 ☗龍-61 ☖金'51! ☗桂'34 ☖玉-41 ☗金x53 ☖玉-32 ☗龍x51 ☖玉-33...
By reaching this position, it becomes clear that Black can't achieve brinkmate.

Many other strategies for Black can be considered, and each attack can be sustained for quite some time. However, I concluded that Black can't reach brinkmate.

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>

is trying to flee through 34-35.
Many continuations are considered, e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗龍-23 ☖玉-42 ☗桂'44 ☖金'33!</br>☗龍-22 ☖玉-43 ☗歩-23+ ☖銀x45 </br>☗とx33 ☖玉-54...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗金'44 ☖玉-42 ☗龍-61 ☖金'51!</br>☗桂'34 ☖玉-41 ☗金x53 ☖玉-32</br>☗龍x51 ☖玉-33...</div></br>

However, none of them seem to work eventually.

<!-- 
The variation of ☖玉-33 is complicated. The king is trying to flee through 34, 35. Black has to block it.

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>
#### A. ☖玉-42!
is also resilient. For example,
<div class="kifu">☗桂'44 ☖金'41! ☗龍x ☖玉-33</br>☗金'36 ☖金x ☗金'25 ☖角'43...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗歩-23+ ☖飛'39 ☗龍-22 ☖歩'32!</br>☗とx ☖玉-52 ☗金'73 ☖玉-43!</br>☗龍x25 ☖飛x32+...</div>

###
In my conclusion, Black can't achieve brinkmate when White defends precisely.

<!-- 
☖玉-42 is also playable.

# More Practically

<!-- 
Finally, I will introduce two more practical situations.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Is Your 玉 Safe?
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/10.png)

I crafted this position, but similar ones often appear in games between top players,
e.g. ☗Sasaki, D.(7dan) - ☖Habu, Y.(9dan) on 2023-09-15.

###
Let's look at the following variation in which they attacked aggressively each other.

<div class="kifu">(☗歩'24) ☖歩x ☗飛x ☖歩'86</br>☗歩x ☖飛x ☗角x22+ ☖銀x</br>☗角'77 ☖飛x89+? ☗角x22+
</div>

<!-- 
I came up with this position, though similar positions can be found in games between top players.
Depending on the variation, the fundamental brinkmate position will be potentially involved. Let's reveal that.

<!-- 
...
This is actually a mistake; ☖歩'23 is better.
...
If White plays ☖桂'86, (*) leads white to brinkmate and Black king is safe.
However, when ☖桂-65 is played here alternatively, choosing this brinkmating line is blunder because ... leads black king to checkmate.
So Black has to play ☗桂-45 or ☗馬x21 for example.
 -->

## Is Your 玉 Safe?
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/11.png)

If White plays <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☖桂'86?</span>,

<div class="kifu">(*) ☗馬x32 ☖玉x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x</br>☗銀'23. (brinkmate)</div></br>

Alternatively if White plays <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☖桂-65</span>, Black can't choose <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">(*)</span> because

<div class="kifu">☖龍x78! ☗銀x ☖桂x57+! ...#</div></br>

Therefore Black should reply
<span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☗桂-45</span> or <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☗馬x21</span>, resulting in an advantageous endgame for Black.

<!-- 
As we have seen, your king can be possibly in danger in the process of brinkmate due to the resources given to the opponent. So concrete calculation becomes necessary.

<!-- _class: small -->
## Pieces in the Opponent's Hand
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/12.png)

In the preceding problems, we have supposed that the opponent has all the off-board pieces in hand.

In actual games, this is not the case. Brinkmate situations often arise due to insufficient resources in hand.

### Example
If White has 銀 or 角, ☖玉 survives.

Otherwise, it is brinkmate.

<!-- 
Another thing you need to think of in a game is whether or not sufficient resources for defense are in the opponent's hand.
Let us think about this example.
If White has a 銀 or 角 and can play ☖銀'22 or ☖角'22, then White can at least prolong. Otherwise, the position is brinkmate.

OK. This completes step 3.

# Summary

<!-- 
Let's wrap up with the today's main points.
 -->
---

## Summary

- Learn fundamental brinkmate positions.
- Calculate checkmates for each of the opponent's replies.
- Add 1 or more pieces on the board and analyze.  
  - That may provide the opponent with means of prolonging,
  - but you may still reach brinkmate with optimal attack.

- Think about chances to lead to brinkmate during your games.

<!-- 
In step 1, we learned a fundamental brinkmate position and confirmed the position is actually brinkmate.
In step 2, we added some pieces to the board and analyzed them. In many cases, it was possible to achieve brinkmate eventually, even in response to White's attempts to prolong the game. This demonstrates the broad applicability of the fundamental position learned in Step 1.
In step 3, I mentioned some important conditions in actual games. With these in mind, I recommend you attempt to lead to brinkmate during your own game.

This concludes "Brinkmate Part 1."

# Ending

## <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Assignment</span>
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/preview.png)
This is the the fundamental position of "**Brinkmate Part 2**."

- Check the position is brinkmate.
- Compare with <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span> in this part.

<!-- 
Here is the preview of the position for Part 2. I hope you make sure that it is brinkmate by the next session.

I plan next time within several months, but it may take longer depending on my job starting next year.
Anyway, I will do my best, so I would appreciate it if you could be patient.(switch)
Bye-bye! -->
