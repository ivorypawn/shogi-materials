# Brinkmate (Part 1)
### Materials For Advanced Shogi Players
TAKAHASHI, Hideaki (髙橋 英晃)

<!-- Hi. I'm Hide.
This channel is established and designed for international shogi players at an advanced level.
The title of this first video is Brinkmate Part 1. -->

## Profile
![bg right:40% 85%](img/profile.png)

### TAKAHASHI, Hideaki (髙橋 英晃)

### Over the Board:
- Won several national amateur titles in 🇯🇵
- Won the world open several times
- Ex-professional 2 dan

### Online Ratings (Maximum):
- 2940 (Shogi Club 24)
- 2769 (Shogi Quest)
- 8 dan (Shogi Wars)

<!-- Since this is the first video of the channel, let me briefly introduce myself.
My full name is Takahashi Hideaki.
I have won several national amateur titles in Japan and other accomplishments as well.
-->

---
## Prerequisite
We use [Kitao–Kawasaki notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi_notation#Kitao%E2%80%93Kawasaki_notation) (Wikipedia) in this material,
e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗歩-76 ☖歩-34 ☗角x22+ ☖銀x ☗角'45.</div></br>

(Because the asterisk "*" already has another use in markdown documents, it has been replaced by the apostrophe " ' ")

##
Also, some notations will be employed from chess terminology.

<!-- Let me also mention the notation that I plan to use in this video and commonly in this channel.
I use modified Kitao–Kawasaki notation. The example line described here is read out like... and so on.
This notation may be unfamiliar to you. It is more like the notation used in Japan and can be easily translated by Japanese players.
In addition, I will also use some chess terminology for convenience.

# What is Brinkmate?

<!-- Now let's get to the today's main part.
What is brinkmate? Do you know brinkmate? -->

---
## Definition
(Quote from [Tomohide Kawasaki, *Japanese-English Shogi Dictionary*, Nekomado, 2013](https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/nekomadoshop/h047.html))

### ひっし 【必至/必死】 *n. Brinkmate.*
A threatmate, in which there is no way for the king's side to avoid the forced mate in the next move.

### ひっしもんだい 【必至問題】 *n. Brinkmate problem.*
A type of shogi problem, in which a partial position is presented, and one must find a solution to force brinkmate to the king with consecutive checks or threatmates.

<!-- If we try to define brinkmate precisely in words, it would be thus. 
...
Often the term "brinkmate" is used to refer to the "brinkmate problem," but in this video, I will try to distinguish between the two.
Later on, we will solve many brinkmate problems. I think some of them will be challenging even for professional players.
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Examples
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/01.png)

It is not always obvious whether a position is brinkmate or not
because there are usually many possible ways of resistance.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
Confirm that this position is brinkmate. In particular, find the mates to the following replies.

- ☖金'22
- ☖飛'92
- ☖飛'42
- ☖角'77

<!-- 
I think few people can properly understand just by reading the description.
Here is a specific example, which is the first exercise today.

The position shown here is brinkmate. You may already know that as it is a typical position.

Here is the list of possible replies by white. Find the lines to mate.
By the way, I suggest you review this list for each position that will appear later.

Please pause the video and calculate until you come to your own conclusion. After a few seconds, we move on to the next page. 
3, 2... OK? Now let's look at the answer. 
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 1</span>

### ☖金'22...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-11 ☗金'21 ☖金x ☗桂x+ ☖玉x ☗金'22#</div>

### ☖飛'92...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'41#</div>

### ☖飛'42...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'21#</div>

### ☖角'77...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'13 ☖玉-31 ☗金'32#</div>

<!--
Here I show only the line after ☖金'22 and skip the rest.
...
In case that you are not sure, I recommend you reproduce on your own board.

---
According to this list, it is only in the variation of ☖角'77 that whether or not ☗桂'13 is possible may affect the result.
-->

---
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/02Q.png)
## Examples
Similar to the position known as typical brinkmate
but this is **NOT** brinkmate!

(If had ☖桂-81, it would be brinkmate)

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
Find a best move by white.

<!-- 
OK. One more exercise.
This position is NOT brinkmate. Not brinkmate, which means there is a way out from mating net.
Can you find how? As before, please pause the video and calculate.
3, 2.. OK, move on to the answer.
 -->

---
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/02A.png)

## Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'27!</div>

###
Other 角 drops on the diagonal are also correct.

Confirm that there is neither line to checkmate nor line to brinkmate.

<!-- 
B'27 is the move. Either B'18 or B'54, for example, is also correct.
Confirm that there is neither mating line nor brinkmating line from here.

The lesson I hope you will learn from this exercise is that whether a position is brinkmate or not is not obvious. -->

# How to proceed with this slide

<!-- Now I would like to mention how this course will proceed. -->
---
## Process
This course proceeds as follows:

1. Confirmation of the fundamental brinkmate position
   - :ballot_box_with_check: done in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 1</span>
2. Analysis of variations of 1.
3. Analysis of more practical cases

## 
For the sake of clarity, we may go back and forth between 2. and 3.

<!-- 
This video consists of 3 steps, excluding the introduction.
In Step 1, I introduce a basic brinkmate position and let you confirm that the position is brinkmate. Today we have already done this step in Exercise 1.
In Step 2, we will see some variations of the position we saw in Step 1 and will consider whether each of them is blinkmate or not.
In Step 3, you will try to solve more practical problems which will occur in a real game.
 -->

## :blue_book: Reference
![bg right:40% 75%](img/book.jpg)

[Takashi Kaneko, **必死道場**. Mynavi. 2019.](https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=105424)

In my view, this is the best book that collects brinkmate problems.

In this slide, the exercises on the book and their variations (which I modified on my own) are marked with emoji :blue_book:.

<!-- 
By the way, I would like to introduce a book here.
There are only a few blinkmate problem books even in Japan, but this "必死道場" is, in my view, the best book among them.
In this video, I will quote some problems from this book. They are marked with this blue_book emoji.

# Variations

<!-- 
Now let's move on to Step 2.
 -->
---
## 香 on the 1st file
<!-- _class: small -->
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3</span>
White turn. Determine if each of the following states are brinkmate or not.
If not, analyse if there is a way to force brinkmate.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.2</span> |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|           ![width:380px](img/01/03-1.png)           |           ![width:380px](img/01/03-2.png)           |

<!-- 
These are the positions with a lance on the 1st file.
Note that the lances block ☗桂'13 (check).
Please pause the video again to calculate whether these differences affect the last conclusion. And when you find the state not brinkmate, consider if there is a continuation to brinkmate or not.
3, 2.. OK, let's move on.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.1</span>

<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div></br>

The 香 blocks ☗桂'13, but at the same time, blocks the escape room by itself.

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 (forced) ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x. (Brinkmate)</div></br>

(e.g. ...☖飛'92 ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#)

<!-- 
The position of exer.3.1 is still brinkmate. 
Let's check the previous list. 

---
However, when white plays ☖角'77 here, ☗金'32#.
And as for the other lines, the existence of the lance doesn't affect the situation.
That's why the position of exer.3.1 is brinkmate.

What about exer.3.2? This time, following ☖角'77☗金'32, white's king can escape to the corner.
Then black continues to attack by ☗桂'33. White must now cover 21 and 22 simultaneously. The sac ☖金'31 doesn't work due to ☗金x☖角x33+☗金'21#. So ☖角x+ is forced and black takes back.

Actually, this position is brinkmate, but have you considered how to checkmate if white makes a last stand here with ☖飛'92?
If not, please pause the video again and calculate... OK? ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#.
So we were able to brinkmate from the position of exer.3.2.
 -->

<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/03X.png)

### (Analysis of ☗桂'24)
Here is an example line after the alternative ☗桂'24:

<div class="kifu">
(☗桂'24) ☖金'22 ☗金'32 ☖玉-11</br>☗金x22 ☖角x+ ☗桂-32+ ☖馬x</br>☗銀x32+ ☖金'21 ☗角'33 ☖歩'22</br>☗+銀x ☖金x ☗歩'23 ☖金'21</br>☗歩x22+ ☖金x ☗金'32 ☖金'21</br>☗金'23 ☖金x32 ☗金x ☖金'21...</div>

###
Led to perpetual.

Note that ☗桂'24 can be effective when the opponent does not have sufficient 金s in hand.

<!-- 
代替手の☗桂'24の変化も調べておきましょう。手順は長いですが、大半は強制手です。
...
結論としてこの変化はドローになります。ただし実戦で白の持ち駒に金が十分ないときは必死になる可能性があります。
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Promoted pieces
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4</span>
White turn. Determine if each of the following states are brinkmate or not.
If not, analyse if there is a way to force brinkmate.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.3</span> :blue_book: |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
|           ![width:380px](img/01/04-1.png)           |           ![width:380px](img/01/04-2.png)           |                 ![width:380px](img/01/04-3.png)                 |

<!-- 
ほかのヴァリエーションを検討してみましょう。
動画を止めて、これらの局面から必死を導くことができるか読んでください。
3, 2... では解答を示します。
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 4.1</span>
<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 4.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖龍-52! (Not Brinkmate)</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 4.3</span>
In common with <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.2</span> in that ☗桂'13 is blocked, the introduction echoes:
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x ☖飛'92 </div></br>

Now the difference appears from <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.2</span>: no immediate mate here, but...
<div class="kifu">☗角'44! (Brinkmate)</div></br>
Ambush! (e.g. ...☖銀'31 ☗金-32 ☖歩'22 ☗銀x+ ☖銀x ☗角x+#)

<!--
The position of Exer. 4.1 is brinkmate. ☖馬-97 の存在は影響を及ぼしません。

As for Exer. 4.2, no brinkmate after white's ☖龍-52. すべての詰み筋がカバーされていることを確認してください。

Exer. 4.3 is a bit more complicated. ☗桂'13がブロックされているため、はじめは Exer. 3.2 と同様に進みます。...
Exer. 3.2 では☗角'22から詰みました。この局面は詰みがありませんが、次の一手で必死になります。☗角'44。これで必死になっていることを確認してください。

Note that if this 馬 were on 35, white could block this diagonal at 44 and the conclusion would change to "Not Brinkmate."

This completes step 2.

# Practical Problems

<!-- 
From here, we will consider positions that are more likely to occur in real games.
 -->
---
## From my own game
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/05.png)

This situation occurred in my own game. At that time I had only 30 seconds. :alarm_clock:

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 5</span>
Lead to brinkmate.

<!-- 
The first exercise in Step 3 is a brinkmate problem extracted from my own game. By the way, that game was a 30-second byoyomi. So if you want to be in the same situation as mine, try to set a 30-second time limit after pausing the video.
3, 2.. Now move on to the answer.
 -->
---
## From my own game
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 5</span>
<div class="kifu">☗桂'74 ☖歩x ☗飛x81+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83.</div></br>

Then we reached the same situation as in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 3.1</span>!

###
(By the way, I initially thought of ☗桂'75. If ☖歩-94 were on 93, ☗桂'75 would threat checkmate followed by ☗飛-82+!)

<!-- 
I believe there are several people who have been able to conceive of the 飛 sacrifice from the context so far.
But immediate ☗飛x81+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83 doesn't work. ☖金'82.

So the correct first move is the 桂 sac. 白は82と62をカバーする必要がありますが、☖銀'71は☗金'62☖銀x☗飛-82+...#です。したがって☖歩xは強制手です。そこで☗飛x81+☖玉x☗銀'83とすれば、親しみのある必死のポジションが現れます。
 -->

## From the book :blue_book:
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6</span> :blue_book:

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.3</span> |

<!-- 
次は先ほど紹介した『必死道場』から数問引用します。Exer. 5 と同じように、基本形への誘導を意識しながらこれらの必死問題を解いてみましょう。
3, 2.. Now move on to the answer.

## From the book :blue_book:
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.1</span>
<div class="kifu">☗馬-41! ☖玉x ☗銀'43.</div></br>

<div class="kifu">☗金'34! ☖玉-22 ☗歩-23+ ☖金x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x ☗金x23.</div>

![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/07Q.png)

## A variation of <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.3</span>
As for <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 6.3</span>, I tried to replace 金 in hand with 飛 and found it interesting position.

Creating variations on your own and analysing can help deepen your understanding of fundamental positions.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span> :blue_book:
Analyse if there is a way to force brinkmate.

<!--
さて、ここでExer. 6.3の持ち駒の金を飛に置換した局面を考えてみましょう。この局面は私のただの思いつきでしたが、考えてみると思いのほか面白い局面でした。
It is the last exercise, and I think highly challenging even for professionals.この問題に限ってはいっぺんに結論を提示せず、問題を分割して説明します。まずは動画を止めて、この局面から必死がかかるかどうか考えてみてください。
3,2..OK? Now move on to next page.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/07A.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 7</span>

No other way at the beginning:
<div class="kifu">☗飛'34 ☖玉-22 ☗飛x32+ ☖玉x</br>☗飛x21+
</div></br>

Since this sacrifice cannot be accepted, the following 3 options remain for white.

1. ☖玉-42
2. ☖玉-43
3. ☖玉-33

###
Which move do you choose?

<!-- 
黒がここから必死をかけようとすれば、導入部は選択の余地がありません。
...
お分かりのように、この龍をとると☗歩-23+で必死がかかります。白の玉は逃げるしかありません。選択肢は3つありますが、あなたが白ならどれを選ぶでしょうか。
数秒後、それぞれの変化の私の結論を示します。あなたが未検討だった場合、もう一度動画を止めてこの局面を考えてください。
3,2..OK, let's move on.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 7</span>
#### 2. ☖玉-43?
leads to the immediate mate:
<div class="kifu">☗龍-41 ☖玉-33 ☗金'23 ☖玉-34 ☗龍-44#</div></br>

#### 3. ☖玉-33!
is trying to flight from the route ☖玉-34~35. Many continuations are considered, e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗龍-23 ☖玉-42 ☗桂'44 ☖金'33! ☗龍-22 ☖玉-43 ☗歩-23+ ☖銀x45 ☗とx33 ☖玉-54...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗金'44 ☖玉-42 ☗龍-61 ☖金'51! ☗桂'34 ☖玉-41 ☗金x53 ☖玉-32 ☗龍x51 ☖玉-33...</div></br>

None of them seem to work eventually.

<!-- 
3つのうち最悪なのは☖玉-43です。これは直ちに玉が詰みます。...

☖玉-33 の変化は難解です。一例を示すと、... ここまでくると、必死はかかりません。
ほかにも黒の攻撃手段はいろいろ考えられ、いずれの攻撃もかなり持続しますが、私は白が適切に対応すれば必死はかからないと結論しました。
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exer. 7</span>
#### 1. ☖玉-42!
is also resilient. Example variations are thus:
<div class="kifu">☗桂'44 ☖金'41! ☗龍x ☖玉-33 ☗金'36 ☖金x ☗金'25 ☖角'43...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗歩-23+ ☖飛'39 ☗龍-22 ☖歩'32 ☗とx ☖玉-52 ☗金'73 ☖玉-43 ☗龍x25 ☖飛x32+...</div>

###
In my conclusion, black cannot brinkmate when white defends precisely.

<!-- 
☖玉-42 も playable な手です。以降の変化の一例を示します。...

このルートも非常に難解ですが、私の結論は「必死がかからない」です。

These lines are very close to brinkmate, and many other variations for black beside them can be considered. However, I think it is unable to brinkmate the king.

演習パートはこれで終わりです。

## uuu
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/10.png)

I created this position for educational purposes, but similar positions often appear in games between top professionals.

For example, ☗Sasaki, D.(7dan) - ☖Habu, Y.(9dan) on 2023-09-15.

###
Let's look at the following variation in which they attacked aggressively each other.
<div class="kifu">(☗歩'24) ☖歩x ☗飛x ☖歩'86</br>☗歩x ☖飛x ☗角x22+ ☖銀x</br>☗角'77 ☖飛x89+? ☗角x22+

<!-- 
この局面は私が勝手につくったものですが、類似の先例はたくさんあります。
まだ序盤と中盤の境界といった段階ですが、ここから互いに積極的に攻めあったとき、これまで述べた必死のポジションが現れる変化があります。

<div class="kifu">(*) ☗馬x32 ☖玉x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x

☗銀'23 (Brinkmate).</div>

<!-- 
この局面になります。ここまでこの動画を観てきたあなたの目にはもう基本形が浮かんでいるのではないでしょうか。
もし☖桂'86ならば...で勝ちになります。
しかし代えて☖桂-65とされたとき黒が(*)を実行すると、☖龍x78!☗銀x☖桂x57!...#です。したがって黒は(*)ではなく☗桂-45や☗馬x21を選ぶべきで、やや優位な終盤に入ります。
このように、実戦では必死をかける際に渡した戦力で自玉が危険になる状況がありえます。concrete calculate.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Lack of pieces in hand
![bg right:50% 75%](img/01/12.png)

Although it is imposed in problem that every other pieces are in opponent's hand, brinkmate is more likely to occur in a real game due to the possibility of the lack of pieces in hand.

For example, this 玉 will survive if there is 銀 or 角 in hand, but otherwise it is brinkmate.

It is necessary to think flexibly in a real game.

<!-- 
もう一つ実戦で気をつけるべき点は、相手の持ち駒です。
このポジションは、白が☖銀'22や☖角'22が可能なら詰みを逃れることができますが、もしそれらの駒がなければ必死です。
これも実戦でconcrete alanysisが重要になるパターンです。
