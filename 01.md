As this is the first video on this channel, let me briefly introduce myself.
My full name is Hideaki Takahashi.
I have won several national amateur titles in Japan and other accomplishments as well.

## Prerequisite
[Kitao–Kawasaki notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi_notation#Kitao%E2%80%93Kawasaki_notation) (Wikipedia) is used in this slide, e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗歩-76 ☖歩-34 ☗角x22+ ☖銀x ☗角'45.</div></br>

(Since the asterisk "*" already serves another purpose in Markdown, they are replaced with apostrophes " ' ")

##
Also, some expressions will be employed from chess terminology.

<!--
And let me mention the notation that I plan to use.
I'll use the modified Kitao–Kawasaki notation. The example line described here is read out for example ... and so on.
Maybe you are not so familiar with this notation. It is closer to the mainstream notation in Japan, but I find it less ambiguous and with higher readability than the Japanese style.
In addition, I will employ some convenient expressions from chess terminology.

# What is Brinkmate?

<!-- Now let's get to the today's main section.
First of all, what is brinkmate? -->

---
## Definition
> [Tomohide Kawasaki, *Japanese-English Shogi Dictionary*, Nekomado, 2013](https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/nekomadoshop/h047.html)

### ひっし 【必至/必死】 *n. Brinkmate.*
A threatmate, in which there is no way for the king's side to avoid the forced mate in the next move.

### ひっしもんだい 【必至問題】 *n. Brinkmate problem.*
A type of shogi problem, in which a partial position is presented, and one must find a solution to force brinkmate to the king with consecutive checks or <u>threatmates</u>.

<!-- If we were to attempt to describe brinkmate in words, it might be thus. 
...
Or this might be clearer: In a game, if you put the opponent's king in brinkmate and there are no immediate means to checkmate your king afterward, your victory is guaranteed.
We will explore specific brinkmate positions starting from the next page.

But before moving on, one more thing. "Brinkmate problem." This is considered as the brinkmate version of 詰将棋. However, please note the sequences for brinkmate problems include not only checks but also threatmates.
Later on, we will solve many brinkmate problems. Some of them will be challenging even for professional players.

Now let's move on to the first step.
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## First Step
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/01.png)

Determining whether a position is brinkmate is not always straightforward.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
Check the position is brinkmate.
In particular, find checkmating lines for each of the following replies.

- ☖金'22
- ☖飛'92
- ☖飛'42
- ☖角'77

<!-- 
The position shown here is brinkmate, and this is the list of possible replies by White. Calculate checkmating lines after each move.
I will now count to three. Please pause the video during this time, calculate until you come to your own conclusion, and then proceed. The same approach will be followed for the subsequent exercises. OK?
3, 2... Now let's look at the answer. 
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/01.png)
#### ☖金'22...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-11 ☗金'21 ☖金x</br>
☗桂x+ ☖玉x ☗金'22#</div>

#### ☖飛'92...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'41#</div>

#### ☖飛'42...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'33 ☖玉-31 ☗金'21#</div>

#### ☖角'77...
<div class="kifu">☗桂'13 ☖玉-31 ☗金'32#</div>

<!--
Here is the solution. I demonstrate only the line after ☖金'22 on the board and skip the rest.
...
-->

---
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/02Q.png)
## Another Example
It resembles a typical brinkmate, but this is **NOT** brinkmate!

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
White to move.

<!-- 
OK. One more exercise.
This position is NOT brinkmate. Not brinkmate, which means there is a way for White's king out from mating net. Please find how.
As before, please pause the video and calculate. 3, 2.. OK.
 -->

---
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/02A.png)

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'27!</div></br>

Other 角 drops on the diagonal are also correct.

###
Confirm that there is no brinkmating line for Black from this position.

<!-- 
B'27 is the move. Either B'18 or B'54, for example, is also correct.

Through these exercises, I hope you understand that determining whether a position is brinkmate is not necessarily straightforward. OK?

# How to Proceed

<!-- Now I would like to mention how this course will proceed. -->
---
## Process
This course proceeds as follows:

1. Confirming that a basic brinkmate position is indeed brinkmate,
   - :ballot_box_with_check: done in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 1</span>
2. Analyzing variations of the basic position,
3. Analyzing more practical positions.


<!-- 
This video consists of 3 steps, excluding the introduction.
In Step 1, I show a basic brinkmate position and let you confirm that the position is actually brinkmate. Today we have already done this step in Exercise 1.
In Step 2, we will see some variations of the basic position and will consider whether or not we can lead to brinkmate from each of them.
In Step 3, we will analyze more practical cases which will occur in actual games.
 -->

## :blue_book: Reference
![bg right:40% 80%](img/book.jpg)

> [Takashi Kaneko, **必死道場**. Mynavi. 2019.](https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=105424)

In my view, this is the most useful book that collects brinkmate problems for practice.

The problems in the book and their variations (which I modified for my purposes) are marked with emoji ':blue_book:' in this slide.

<!-- 
BTW, I would like to introduce a book here.
There are only a few brinkmate problem books even in Japan, but this book titled as "必死道場" is, in my view, the best book among them.
In step 2 and step 3, I will quote some of the brinkmate problems included in this book, either verbatim or in my modified form. Just in case, I have contacted the author for permission regarding the quotes, and obtained consent.
The quoted problems will be marked with this blue_book emoji.

# Variations

<!-- 
Now let's move on to Step 2.
 -->
---
## 香 on the 1st File
<!-- _class: small -->
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3</span>
White to move.
Analyze whether or not each of the following positions is brinkmate.
If not, calculate whether Black can lead to brinkmate in several moves.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">3.2</span> |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|           ![width:380px](img/01/03-1.png)           |           ![width:380px](img/01/03-2.png)           |

<!-- 
In these positions, a lance is placed on the 1st file preventing ☗桂'13.
Please pause the video again to calculate whether or not each difference affects. And if you determine that it is not brinkmate, which means White has a reply to avoid immediate mating line, consider whether Black can achieve brinkmate in a few moves.
OK? 3, 2.. now move on to the answer.
 -->

---
## 香 on the 1st File
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.1</span>

<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div></br>

The 香 blocks ☗桂'13, but at the same time, blocks the escape room by itself.

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 (forced) ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x. (brinkmate)</div></br>

(e.g. ...☖飛'92 ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#)

<!-- 
The position of Exercise 3.1 is brinkmate. 
As I mentioned ☗桂'13 check is blocked, but ☖角'77 doesn't prevent another checkmate ☗金'32#. And as for the other lines, the lance works nothing.

In Exercise 3.2, following ☖角'77 ☗金'32, White's king can escape to the corner.
Black continues to attack by ☗桂'33. Then White has to cover the squares 21 and 22 simultaneously. The sacrifice ☖金'31 doesn't work due to ☗金x ☖角x33+ ☗金'21#. So here ☖角x+ is forced. Black takes back.

Actually, this position is brinkmate, but have you considered ☖飛'92 and how to checkmate from here? If haven't, please pause the video again and calculate... OK? ☗角'22 ☖玉-21 ☗銀x12+ ☖玉x ☗香'13 ☖玉-21 ☗香-11+#.
In conclusion, Black can brinkmate in 7 moves, starting from ☗銀'23.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/03X.png)

### Further Note: ☗桂'24
Delve into the alternative ☗桂'24:

<div class="kifu">(☗桂'24) ☖金'22 (forced)</br>☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗金x22 ☖角x+</div>

###
then Black has 2 possible options:

A. ☗桂-32+
B. ☗金'33

#### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise </span>(Optional)
Which move is better?
Or does it lead to the same?

<!-- 
Regarding Exercise 3.2, let's consider an alternative ☗桂'24, apart from ☗金'32.
...

You have 2 options here. ... Which move do you think better?
Just for your information, this optional exercise is quite challenging. If you decide to take on the challenge, the time to pause this video might be long. OK? Now, let's move on.
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Further Note: ☗桂'24

#### A. ☗桂-32+?
<div class="kifu">☖馬x ☗銀x32+ ☖金'21 ☗角'44 ☖歩'22 ☗+銀x ☖金x ☗歩'23 ☖金'21 ☗歩x22+</br>☖金x ☗金'32 ☖金'21 ☗金'23 ☖金x32 ☗金x ☖金'21... (perpetual)</div>

#### B. ☗金'33!
<div class="kifu">☖馬x23 ☗金x ☖金'22 ☗角'44 ☖金'21 ☗桂x12+ ☖金21x ☗香'19 ☖金'21 ☗香x12+</br>☖金12x ☗角x22+ ☖金x ☗金'13 ☖飛'92 ☗金23x22 ☖飛x22 ☗金'13 ☖金'12 ☗金13x22</br>☖金x22 ☗飛'31</div>

</br>With no matter which piece White defends, Black can reach brinkmate, e.g.
- ☖歩'21 ☗金x22 ☖玉x ☗金'33 ☖玉-13 ☗飛x21+ (brinkmate)
- ☖桂'21 ☗金'32...
  - ☖金x ☗飛x+ (brinkmate)
  - ☖金'12 ☗金x21...#

<!-- 
Here is the solution. Due to the length of the sequences, I'll skip detailed explanations for each move and only demonstrate on the board.
...
That results in perpetual.
...
Here 金 is out of stock in White's hand.
...
Now White has to put some piece on 21, but no matter which piece, Black can achieve brinkmate eventually.

As my conclusion, choosing ☗桂'24 will still lead to brinkmate in the end. However, it takes over 30 moves from the initial position, making it less straightforward compared to the main line.
-->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## With a Promoted Piece
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4</span>
White to move.
Analyze whether or not each of the following positions is brinkmate.
If not, calculate whether Black can lead to brinkmate in several moves.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">4.3</span> :blue_book: |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
|           ![width:380px](img/01/04-1.png)           |           ![width:380px](img/01/04-2.png)           |                 ![width:380px](img/01/04-3.png)                 |

<!-- 
Let's consider other variations.
Pause the video and analyze whether brinkmate can be achieved from each of these positions.
3, 2... now let's reveal the answer.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4.1</span>
<div class="kifu">Brinkmate.</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☖龍-52! (not brinkmate)</div>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 4.3</span>
In common with <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span> in that ☗桂'13 is blocked, the introduction echoes:
<div class="kifu">☖角'77 ☗金'32 ☖玉-11 ☗桂'33 ☖角x+ ☗金x ☖飛'92 </div></br>

Now the difference appears from <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.2</span>: no immediate mate here, but...
<div class="kifu">☗角'44! (brinkmate)</div></br>
Ambush! (e.g. ...☖銀'31 ☗金-32 ☖歩'22 ☗銀x+ ☖銀x ☗角x+#)

<!--
The position of Exercise 4.1 is brinkmate. The ☖馬 on 97 doesn't affect the outcome.

As for Exercise 4.2, there is no brinkmating line after ☖龍-52.

Exercise 4.3 is a bit more complicated compared to the previous two. Since the ☖馬 is preventing ☗桂'13, the line is similar to that of Exercise 3.2
...
Up to this point, the sequence was the same as in Exercise 3.2. In Exercise 3.2, it was brinkmate. This time there is no mating line after ☖飛'92, but next ☗角'44 makes it brinkmate because White can't prevent the coming ☗金-32, discovered check shuting the rook. Do you understand?

Note that if the ☖馬 were on 35 at the initial position, White could have blocked this diagonal at 44 and the conclusion would have changed.

OK. This completes step 2.

# Practical Problems

<!-- 
From here, we will consider positions that are more likely to occur in real games.
 -->
---
## From a Game
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/05.png)

(This situation occurred in my own game. At that time I had only 30 seconds :alarm_clock:)

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 5</span>
Black to move. Brinkmate in several moves.

<!-- 
The first exercise in Step 3 is a brinkmate problem extracted from my actual game.
By the way, it was a 30-second byoyomi. So if you want to be in the same situation as mine, set a 30-second time limit after pausing the video.
3, 2.. Now move on to the answer.
 -->
---
## From a Game
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 5</span>
<div class="kifu">☗桂'74 ☖歩x ☗飛x81+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83.</div></br>

Then reached the same situation as in <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 3.1</span>.

###
(I initially thought of ☗桂'75. If ☖歩 were on 93, it would have been threatmate followed by ☗飛-82+!)

<!-- 
I assume several people could conceive of the 飛 sacrifice from the context so far. But immediate ☗飛x81+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83 doesn't work with ☖金'82.

The correct first move is the 桂 sacrifice. Taking the knight is forced because any other reply, for example ☖銀'71, results in checkmate: ☗金'62 ☖銀x ☗飛-82+ and so on. So ☖歩x ☗飛x桂+ ☖玉x ☗銀'83, then reached brinkmate.
 -->

---
## From the Book :blue_book:
### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6</span> :blue_book:
Black to move. Brinkmate in several moves.

| <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.1</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.2</span> | <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">6.3</span> |

<!-- 
Next, I will quote several problems from the book introduced earlier. Similar to Exercise 5, let's solve these problems with a focus on guiding towards the basic brinkmate position.
3, 2.. Now move on to the answer.
-->

## From the Book :blue_book:
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6.1</span>
<div class="kifu">☗馬-41 ☖玉x ☗銀'43.</div></br>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6.2</span>
<div class="kifu">☗桂'24 ☖歩x ☗馬x22 ☖玉x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x ☗銀'23.</div></br>

### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6.3</span>
<div class="kifu">☗金'34 ☖玉-22 ☗歩-23+ ☖金x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x ☗金x23.</div>

![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/07Q.png)

## A Variation of <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6.3</span>
As for <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 6.3</span>, I tried to replace 金 in hand with 飛 and found it interesting position.

Creating variations on your own and analysing can help deepen your understanding of fundamental positions.

### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span> :blue_book:
Black to move.
Calculate whether or not Black can reach brinkmate.

<!--
Now, let's think about the position in Exercise 6.3 where replaced the 金 in hand with a 飛. It was just a whim of mine, but upon reflection, the position reveals its depth.
Calculate whether or not Black can reach brinkmate.
This is the today's last exercise and highly challenging one.
3,2.. OK? Now move on to next page.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/07A.png)
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>

No other way at the beginning:
<div class="kifu">☗飛'34 ☖玉-22 ☗飛x32+ ☖玉x</br>☗飛x21+
</div></br>

Since White can't accept this sac, the following 3 options remain.

A. ☖玉-42
B. ☖玉-43
C. ☖玉-33

#### <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise </span>(Optional)
Which move is better?
Or does it lead to the same?

<!-- 
Attempting to brinkmate, there is no other room for the first moves.
...
As you can see, capturing this 龍 leads to brinkmate. White's king has no choice but to flee. Although there are 3 options, if you were playing as White, which one would you choose?
If you haven't thought about this position yet, please pause the video again and come to a conclusion. OK?
3,2.. let's move on.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>
#### B. ☖玉-43?
leads to immediate checkmate:
<div class="kifu">☗龍-41 ☖玉-33 ☗金'23 ☖玉-34 ☗龍-44#</div></br>

#### C. ☖玉-33!
is trying to flee through 34-35. Many continuations are considered, e.g.
<div class="kifu">☗龍-23 ☖玉-42 ☗桂'44 ☖金'33! ☗龍-22 ☖玉-43 ☗歩-23+ ☖銀x45 ☗とx33 ☖玉-54...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗金'44 ☖玉-42 ☗龍-61 ☖金'51! ☗桂'34 ☖玉-41 ☗金x53 ☖玉-32 ☗龍x51 ☖玉-33...</div></br>

However, none of them seem to work eventually.

<!-- 
The worst among the three options is ☖玉-43. This move results in an immediate checkmate.
...

The variation of ☖玉-33 is complicated.
One imaginable line is ... 
By reaching this position, it becomes clear that Black can't achieve brinkmate.

Many other strategies for Black can be considered, and each attack can be sustained for quite some time. However, I have concluded that with White's precise defences, there is no brinkmate.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
### Solution to <span style="color: var(--hide-yellow);">Exercise 7</span>
#### A. ☖玉-42!
is also resilient. For example,
<div class="kifu">☗桂'44 ☖金'41! ☗龍x ☖玉-33 ☗金'36 ☖金x ☗金'25 ☖角'43...</div>
or
<div class="kifu">☗歩-23+ ☖飛'39 ☗龍-22 ☖歩'32 ☗とx ☖玉-52 ☗金'73 ☖玉-43 ☗龍x25 ☖飛x32+...</div>

###
In my conclusion, Black can't achieve brinkmate when White defends precisely.

<!-- 
☖玉-42 is also playable.
One imaginable line is ...

This variation is also intricate, but my conclusion is that it cannot result in brinkmate.

<!-- _class: standout -->
# More Practically

<!-- 
Finally, I will introduce two more practical situations.
 -->
---

<!-- _class: small -->
## Is Your 玉 Safe?
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/10.png)

I crafted this position, but similar ones often appear in games between top players,
e.g. ☗Sasaki, D.(7dan) - ☖Habu, Y.(9dan) on 2023-09-15.

###
Let's look at the following variation in which they attacked aggressively each other.

<div class="kifu">(☗歩'24) ☖歩x ☗飛x ☖歩'86</br>☗歩x ☖飛x ☗角x22+ ☖銀x</br>☗角'77 ☖飛x89+? ☗角x22+
</div>

<!-- 
I came up with this position. And similar positions can be found in games between top players.
Depending on the variation, the basic brinkmate position will be potentially involved. Let's reveal that.
...
This is actually a mistake; ☖歩'23 is better.
...
 -->

---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Is Your 玉 Safe?
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/11.png)

If White plays <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☖桂'86?</span>,

<div class="kifu">(*) ☗馬x32 ☖玉x ☗飛x21+ ☖玉x</br>☗銀'23. (brinkmate)</div></br>

Alternatively if White plays <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☖桂-65</span>, Black can't choose <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">(*)</span> because

<div class="kifu">☖龍x78! ☗銀x ☖桂x57+! ...#</div></br>

Therefore Black should reply
<span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☗桂-45</span> or <span style="color: var(--hide-green);">☗馬x21</span>, resulting in an advantageous endgame for Black.

<!-- 
Then we reached this position.
If White plays ☖桂'86, (*) leads white to brinkmate and Black king is safe.
However, when ☖桂-65 is played here alternatively, choosing this brinkmating line is blunder because ... leads black king to checkmate.
So Black has to play ☗桂-45 or ☗馬x21 for example.
As we have seen, your king can be possibly in danger in the process of brinkmate due to the resources given to the opponent. So concrete calculation becomes necessary.
 -->
---
<!-- _class: small -->
## Pieces in the Opponent's Hand
![bg right:45% 90%](img/01/12.png)

In the preceding problems, we have supposed that the opponent has all the off-board pieces in hand.

In actual games, this is not the case. Brinkmate situations often arise due to insufficient resources in hand.

### Example
If White has 銀 or 角, ☖玉 survives.

Otherwise, it is brinkmate.

<!-- 
Another thing you need to think of in a game is whether or not sufficient resources for defense are in the opponent's hand.
Let us think about this example.
If White has a 銀 or 角 and can play ☖銀'22 or ☖角'22, then White can at least prolong. Otherwise, the situation is brinkmate.

OK. This completes step 3.

## Summary

- Learn basic brinkmate positions.
- Calculate checkmates for each of the opponent's replies.
- Add 1 or more pieces on the board and analyze.  
  - That may provide the opponent with means of prolonging,
  - but you may still reach brinkmate with optimal attack.

- Think about chances to lead to brinkmate during your games.

<!-- 
In step 1, we learned a basic brinkmate position and confirmed the position is actually brinkmate.
In step 2, we added some pieces on the board and analyzed. In many cases, it was possible to achieve brinkmate eventually, even in response to White's attempts to prolong the game. This demonstrates the broad applicability of the basic position learned in Step 1.
In step 3, I mentioned some important conditions in actual games. With these in mind, I recommend you to attempt to lead to brinkmate during your own game.

This concludes "Brinkmate Part 1."

<!-- 
I will preview the basic position for Part 2. Please make sure that it is brinkmate by the next session.

By the way, I can't say when I will complete the material for the next video.
This year, I left my previous job, moved to my hometown, and decided to make this video, and now, about 6 months later, I have completed it. It may be faster next time as I'm getting used to it, or it may take longer if I get busy with my job starting next year. 
Anyway I will do my best. Bye-bye!
